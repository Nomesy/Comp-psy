## Print
1) See [yourname](https://github.com/Nomesy/Comp-psy/blob/main/Assignment%202/yourname.py)
2) No variables appeared in the editor

## Operations
1) See [operations](https://github.com/Nomesy/Comp-psy/blob/main/Assignment%202/Operations.py). They both output the answer 2.5.
2) See [operations](https://github.com/Nomesy/Comp-psy/blob/main/Assignment%202/Operations.py). Modulo divides the numbers and outputs the remainder of the division operation, such as outputting 2 from an input of 8/3.
3) See [operations](https://github.com/Nomesy/Comp-psy/blob/main/Assignment%202/Operations.py). // compliments modulo because it provides the number of times one number fits inside of another. For instance, it outputs 2 from an input of 11/4  because 4 fits into 11 2 times but leaves a remainder of 3 which isn't enough for the third group of 4. ** is for performing exponent operations in python.
5) See [operations](https://github.com/Nomesy/Comp-psy/blob/main/Assignment%202/Operations.py). python does seem to follow the order of operations going off the results of the equations used.


## Variables
1) See [yourname modified](https://github.com/Nomesy/Comp-psy/blob/main/Assignment%202/yourname%20modified.py).
2) See [yourname modified](https://github.com/Nomesy/Comp-psy/blob/main/Assignment%202/yourname%20modified.py). yes (letter1=k, letter2=y, letter3=l,  letter4=e)
3) See [yourname modified](https://github.com/Nomesy/Comp-psy/blob/main/Assignment%202/yourname%20modified.py). Python does not have any problems with variables having the same value.
4) See [yourname modified](https://github.com/Nomesy/Comp-psy/blob/main/Assignment%202/yourname%20modified.py). Do not have repeat letters in my name.
5) See [yourname modified](https://github.com/Nomesy/Comp-psy/blob/main/Assignment%202/yourname%20modified.py). Changing the value of letterx did not affect the other variable.
6) See [yourname modified](https://github.com/Nomesy/Comp-psy/blob/main/Assignment%202/yourname%20modified.py). It did not change the value of letterx, this tells me that variables are not automatically “updated” to match new values that come after it was defined.


## Boolean
1) See [Boolean](https://github.com/Nomesy/Comp-psy/blob/main/Assignment%202/boolean.py).1 and 1.0 are equivalent but ‘1’ and ‘1.0’ are not. This is likely because 1 and 1.0 are numerals and represent the same numerical value. However,  ‘1’ and ‘1.0’ are strings and thus act more like words.
2) See [Boolean](https://github.com/Nomesy/Comp-psy/blob/main/Assignment%202/boolean.py). Yes, it is equivalent.
3) See [Boolean](https://github.com/Nomesy/Comp-psy/blob/main/Assignment%202/boolean.py).
            print(1 == 1.0 or "1" == "1.0" and 5 == (3+2))
            print(1 == 1.0 and not "1" == "1.0" or 5 == (3+2))
            print(1 == 1.0 or "1" == "1.0" or 5 == (3+2))
            print(1 == 1.0 or "1" == "1.0" and not 5 == (3+2))
            print(1 == 1.0 and not "1" == "1.0" and 5 == (3+2))       

## List
1) See [List](https://github.com/Nomesy/Comp-psy/blob/main/Assignment%202/list.py). Oddlist did become a variable.
2) See [List](https://github.com/Nomesy/Comp-psy/blob/main/Assignment%202/list.py).
3) See [List](https://github.com/Nomesy/Comp-psy/blob/main/Assignment%202/list.py). It says that it is 5 long.
4) See [List](https://github.com/Nomesy/Comp-psy/blob/main/Assignment%202/list.py). It says it is a list.
5) See [List](https://github.com/Nomesy/Comp-psy/blob/main/Assignment%202/list.py).
6) See [List](https://github.com/Nomesy/Comp-psy/blob/main/Assignment%202/list.py). It does list all integers between 0 and 100.


## Dictionary
1) See [Dictionary](https://github.com/Nomesy/Comp-psy/blob/main/Assignment%202/dictionary.py).
2) See [Dictionary](https://github.com/Nomesy/Comp-psy/blob/main/Assignment%202/dictionary.py).
3) See [Dictionary](https://github.com/Nomesy/Comp-psy/blob/main/Assignment%202/dictionary.py). It counts the number of components that make up the dictionary in this case there were 4 (name, year of study, age, favourite foods).

## Array
1) See [Array](https://github.com/Nomesy/Comp-psy/blob/main/Assignment%202/array.py). The integers are converted into floats so the entire array is displayed as integers rather than mixed numbers.
2) See [Array](https://github.com/Nomesy/Comp-psy/blob/main/Assignment%202/array.py). The floats and integers are converted into strings.
3) See [Array](https://github.com/Nomesy/Comp-psy/blob/main/Assignment%202/array.py).
4) See [Array](https://github.com/Nomesy/Comp-psy/blob/main/Assignment%202/array.py).
