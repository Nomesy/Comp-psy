operations
1) See [operations]. They both output the answer 2.5.
2) See [operations]. Modulo divides the numbers and outputs the remainder of the division operation, such as outputting 2 from an input of 8/3.
3) See [operations]. // compliments modulo because it provides the number of times one number fits inside of another. For instance, it outputs 2 from an input of 11/4  because 4 fits into 11 2 times but leaves a remainder of 3 which isn't enough for the third group of 4. ** is for performing exponent operations in python.
5) See [operations]. python does seem to follow the order of operations going off the results of the equations used.


Variables
1) See [Variables].
2) See [Variables]. yes (letter1=k, letter2=y, letter3=l,  letter4=e)
3) See [Variables]. Python does not have any problems with variables having the same value.
4) See [Variables]. Do not have repeat letters in my name.
5) See [Variables]. Changing the value of letterx did not affect the other variable.
6) See [Variables]. It did not change the value of letterx, this tells me that variables are not automatically “updated” to match new values that come after it was defined.


Boolean
1) See [Boolean].1 and 1.0 are equivalent but ‘1’ and ‘1.0’ are not. This is likely because 1 and 1.0 are numerals and represent the same numerical value. However,  ‘1’ and ‘1.0’ are strings and thus act more like words.
2) See [Boolean]. Yes, it is equivalent.
3) See [Boolean].

List
1) See [List]. Oddlist did become a variable.
2) See [List].
3) See [List]. It says that it is 5 long.
4) See [List]. It says it is a list.
5) See [List].
6) See [List]. It does list all integers between 0 and 100.


Dictionary
1) See (file name)
2) See (file name)
3) It counts the number of components that make up the dictionary in this case there were 4 (name, year of study, age, favourite foods).

Array
1) See [Array]. The integers are converted into floats so the entire array is displayed as integers rather than mixed numbers.
2) See [Array]. The floats and integers are converted into strings.
3) See [Array].
4) See [Array].
