## Wait exercises
See [Assignment 7 Wait and wait timer](https://github.com/Nomesy/Comp-psy/blob/main/Assignment%207/Assignment%207%20Wait%20and%20wait%20timer.py).

## Clock exercises
For the sake of readability and convenience of switching between timing methods I split them up.
- 1. See [Assignment 7 Wait and wait timer](https://github.com/Nomesy/Comp-psy/blob/main/Assignment%207/Assignment%207%20Wait%20and%20wait%20timer.py). Instead of 2 seconds core.wait was actually about 2.016 (2.011-2.020) seconds on average.
            - Stimuli 0 time = 2.0179283999605104
            - Stimuli 1 time = 2.0122447999892756
            - Stimuli 2 time = 2.019175700028427
            
2. See [Assignment 7 Clock wait timer](https://github.com/Nomesy/Comp-psy/blob/main/Assignment%207/Assignment%207%20Clock%20wait%20timer.py). Instead of 2 seconds countdown_timer was actually about 2.012 (2.000-2.017) seconds on average. It is slightly better than core.wait.
- Stimuli 0 time = 2.0178016000427306
            - Stimuli 1 time = 2.0157623001141474
            - Stimuli 2 time = 2.0007741999579594
            
3. See [Assignment 7 Countdown](https://github.com/Nomesy/Comp-psy/blob/main/Assignment%207/Assignment%207%20Countdown.py). Instead of 2 seconds countdown_timer was actually about 2.011 (2.000-2.017) seconds on average. It is slightly better than core.wait.
            - Stimuli 0 time = 2.00198980001732
            - Stimuli 1 time = 2.016483400017023
            - Stimuli 2 time = 2.0152765000239015
            
4. See [Assignment 7 Trial and block timer](https://github.com/Nomesy/Comp-psy/blob/main/Assignment%207/Assignment%207%20Trial%20and%20block%20timer.py).

## Frame-based timing exercises
1. See [Assignment 7 Frames](https://github.com/Nomesy/Comp-psy/blob/main/Assignment%207/Assignment%207%20Frames.py).
2. Dropped frames are ussually under 6, so keeping the frame-based method.
