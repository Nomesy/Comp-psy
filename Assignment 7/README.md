## Wait exercises
See [Assignment 7 Wait and wait timer](https://github.com/Nomesy/Comp-psy/blob/main/Assignment%207/Assignment%207%20Wait%20and%20wait%20timer.py).

## Clock exercises
1. See [Assignment 7 Wait and wait timer](https://github.com/Nomesy/Comp-psy/blob/main/Assignment%207/Assignment%207%20Wait%20and%20wait%20timer.py). Instead of 2 seconds core.wait was actually about 2.016 (2.014-2.018) seconds on average.
2. See [Assignment 7 Clock wait timer](https://github.com/Nomesy/Comp-psy/blob/main/Assignment%207/Assignment%207%20Clock%20wait%20timer.py). Instead of 2 seconds countdown_timer was actually about 2.010 (2.000-2.017) seconds on average.
3. See [Assignment 7 Countdown](https://github.com/Nomesy/Comp-psy/blob/main/Assignment%207/Assignment%207%20Countdown.py). Instead of 2 seconds countdown_timer was actually about 2.015 (2.014-2.017) seconds on average.
4. See [Assignment 7 Trial and block timer](https://github.com/Nomesy/Comp-psy/blob/main/Assignment%207/Assignment%207%20Trial%20and%20block%20timer.py).

## Frame-based timing exercises
1. See [Assignment 7 Frames](https://github.com/Nomesy/Comp-psy/blob/main/Assignment%207/Assignment%207%20Frames.py).
2. Dropped frames are ussually under 6 so keeping the frame-based method.
